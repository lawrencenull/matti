## Description
Matti is a semi-intelligent personal assistant written in Javascript.  The code is fairly barebones so that it can be ported to a various number of applications.  The codebase relies on a pre-defined JSON "question bank" which contains a breakdown typical phrases and questions, along with an "unknown" section when no other response applies.
